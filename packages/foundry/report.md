# Low Issues

## L-1: Centralization Risk

Contracts have owners with privileged rights to perform admin tasks and need to be trusted to not perform malicious updates or drain funds.

<details><summary>2 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in contracts/DecentralizedResistanceToken.sol [Line: 8](contracts/DecentralizedResistanceToken.sol#L8)

	```solidity
	contract DecentralizedResistanceToken is ERC20, Ownable(msg.sender) {
	```

- Found in contracts/DecentralizedResistanceToken.sol [Line: 15](contracts/DecentralizedResistanceToken.sol#L15)

	```solidity
	    function setVotingContract(address _votingContract) external onlyOwner {
	```

</details>



## L-2: Unspecific Solidity Pragma

Consider using a specific version of Solidity in your contracts instead of a wide version. For example, instead of `pragma solidity ^0.8.0;`, use `pragma solidity 0.8.0;`

<details><summary>2 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in contracts/DecentralizedResistanceToken.sol [Line: 2](contracts/DecentralizedResistanceToken.sol#L2)

	```solidity
	pragma solidity ^0.8.19;
	```

- Found in contracts/Governance.sol [Line: 2](contracts/Governance.sol#L2)

	```solidity
	pragma solidity ^0.8.19;
	```

</details>



## L-3: Address State Variable Set Without Checks

Check for `address(0)` when assigning values to address state variables.

<details><summary>1 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in contracts/DecentralizedResistanceToken.sol [Line: 16](contracts/DecentralizedResistanceToken.sol#L16)

	```solidity
	        votingContract = _votingContract;
	```

</details>



## L-4: PUSH0 Opcode

Solc compiler version 0.8.20 switches the default target EVM version to Shanghai, which means that the generated bytecode will include PUSH0 opcodes. Be sure to select the appropriate EVM version in case you intend to deploy on a chain other than mainnet like L2 chains that may not support PUSH0, otherwise deployment of your contracts will fail.

<details><summary>2 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in contracts/DecentralizedResistanceToken.sol [Line: 2](contracts/DecentralizedResistanceToken.sol#L2)

	```solidity
	pragma solidity ^0.8.19;
	```

- Found in contracts/Governance.sol [Line: 2](contracts/Governance.sol#L2)

	```solidity
	pragma solidity ^0.8.19;
	```

</details>



## L-5: Modifier Invoked Only Once

Consider removing the modifier or inlining the logic into the calling function.

<details><summary>2 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in contracts/Governance.sol [Line: 59](contracts/Governance.sol#L59)

	```solidity
	    modifier doesProposalExist(uint256 proposalId) {
	```

- Found in contracts/Governance.sol [Line: 73](contracts/Governance.sol#L73)

	```solidity
	    modifier checkIfQueueIsFull() {
	```

</details>



## L-6: Missing Inheritance

There is an interface / abstract contract that is potentially missing (not included in) the inheritance of this contract.

<details><summary>1 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in contracts/Governance.sol [Line: 6](contracts/Governance.sol#L6)

	Is this contract supposed to implement an interface? Consider extending one of the following: IGovernance
	```solidity
	contract Governance {
	```

</details>



## L-7: Unused Import

Redundant import statement. Consider removing it.

<details><summary>1 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in contracts/DecentralizedResistanceToken.sol [Line: 6](contracts/DecentralizedResistanceToken.sol#L6)

	```solidity
	import { console2 } from "../lib/forge-std/src/console2.sol";
	```

</details>



## L-8: State Change Without Event

There are state variable changes in this function but no event is emitted. Consider emitting an event to enable offchain indexers to track the changes.

<details><summary>1 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in contracts/DecentralizedResistanceToken.sol [Line: 15](contracts/DecentralizedResistanceToken.sol#L15)

	```solidity
	    function setVotingContract(address _votingContract) external onlyOwner {
	```
